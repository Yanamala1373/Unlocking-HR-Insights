# Unlocking-HR-Insights
Human Resource (HR) data analytics is a rapidly growing field that leverages data-driven insights to optimize workforce management and decision-making. This project addresses the critical need for data-driven decision-making in Human Resources by developing an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze employee attendance patterns. Leveraging publicly available real-world datasets, specifically attendance sheets from different platforms, this initiative aims to empower HR Generalists with actionable insights regarding employee retention, sick leave trends, work from home (WFH) and work from office (WFO).

The methodology encompasses a comprehensive data lifecycle, starting with data collection and meticulous transformation using Power Query to consolidate and restructure attendance data for effective analysis. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is employed to create dynamic measures, enabling a granular understanding of attendance dynamics. The resulting Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations. This project demonstrates the application of HR analytics to improve workforce management by providing a robust framework for continuous updates and enhancements. The dashboard enables HR professionals to strategically plan key events, implement targeted retention strategies, and address factors contributing to sick leave percentages. By quantifying and visualizing attendance data, this project provides a foundation for enhancing employee satisfaction, well-being, and overall organizational effectiveness.


1.1	Purpose

In today’s competitive business landscape, Human Resources (HR) departments are increasingly tasked with strategic decision-making that directly impacts organizational performance. Traditional, intuition-based approaches are being superseded by data-driven methodologies, enabling HR professionals to gain deeper insights into workforce dynamics and optimize human capital management. This project, "Unlocking HR Insights," aims to leverage the power of data analytics to transform raw employee attendance data into actionable intelligence, specifically focusing on patterns, trends, and key performance indicators related to attendance.

The primary purpose of this project is to develop an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard that enables HR Generalists to effectively analyze employee attendance data. By visualizing key metrics such as present percentages, sick leave rates, and WFH/WFO distributions, the project aims to equip HR with the tools necessary to:
•	Identify and understand employee attendance patterns: Uncover trends related to absenteeism, punctuality, and work location preferences. 
•	Develop targeted retention strategies: Identify potential areas of concern related to employee engagement and well-being, informing interventions to improve retention. 
•	Analyze sick leave trends: Understand the factors contributing to sick leave rates and implement strategies to promote employee health and well-being. 
•	Optimize workforce management: Gain insights into the balance between WFH and WFO arrangements to enhance productivity and employee satisfaction. 
•	Facilitate strategic planning: Provide data-driven insights to inform you about the scheduling and rescheduling of key organizational events.

This project demonstrates the application of HR analytics to improve workforce management by providing a robust framework for continuous updates and enhancements. The dashboard enables HR professionals to strategically plan key events, implement targeted retention strategies, and address factors contributing to sick leave percentages. By quantifying and visualizing attendance data, this project provides a foundation for enhancing employee satisfaction, well-being, and overall organizational effectiveness.

1.2 Scope

The scope of this project is focused on the analysis of employee attendance data collected over a three-month period, encompassing key metrics such as present days, sick leaves, and the distribution of Work From Home (WFH) and Work From Office (WFO) arrangements. By utilizing publicly available real-world datasets, this project aims to demonstrate the practical application of HR analytics in a real-world scenario. The analysis will delve into identifying trends and anomalies in attendance patterns, determining the underlying reasons for fluctuations in sick leave percentages, and providing a clear understanding of the balance between WFH and WFO arrangements. The project will also facilitate the strategic planning and scheduling of key organizational events based on derived insights, ensuring alignment with workforce availability and productivity. The project will primarily focus on the data transformation and reporting of the attendance data provided and will not include predictive modelling or external data integration.

1.3	Proposed Algorithm

A The proposed system leverages a multi-faceted approach, employing a combination of data transformation, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques.

The initial stage involves meticulous data collection and transformation using Power Query in Power BI, ensuring that the raw attendance data is cleaned, consolidated, and structured for effective analysis. This process includes data reshaping, combining datasets, and applying necessary transformations to create a unified and consistent dataset. 

Subsequently, Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) will be utilized to create dynamic measures, including total working days, WFH and sick leave counts, present days, and corresponding percentages. These measures will enable a granular understanding of attendance dynamics and facilitate the identification of key trends and patterns. 

The project will employ statistical operations to derive meaningful metrics and create calculated columns to enhance the analytical capabilities of the dashboard. Finally, the project will culminate in the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard, incorporating various visualization techniques such as card visuals, date slicers, employee data tables, and trend charts. 

These visualizations will provide a clear and intuitive representation of the analyzed data, enabling HR professionals to quickly identify key insights and make data-driven decisions. The chosen algorithms and techniques are selected to provide a robust and adaptable framework for continuous updates and enhancements to the HR analytics process, ensuring that the insights derived remain relevant and actionable over time.
